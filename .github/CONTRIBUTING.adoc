- If an external library is used, make sure to abstract through interfaces.

=== How to submit a contribution.

1. Create new branch prefixed with `feature/` to add new features or `fix/` to solve a bug
2. Do the changes in your branch with small commits and all necessary tests
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    - Make sure the tests are successful.
    - Make sure the linter passes.
    - Make sure to generate the JSDoc documentation if necessary.
    - Send a pull request with the completed base template indicating your change.

== How to report a bug

== How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in main-fns, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that main-fns has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub, fill the template which describes the feature you would like to see, and how it should work. If it turns out to be a very large functionality, it will be introduced in the roadmap and prioritized along with the rest of the objectives

== Community

Remember that you have the discussion section to provide ideas, resolve doubts or simply stay in touch with the main-fns community

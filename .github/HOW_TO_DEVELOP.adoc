= How to develop

== Requirements for development

- make (optional but highly recommended)
- docker
- docker-compose

== Introduction

This project is built with docker-compose and make. You can run the commands directly with npm but **it is highly recommended to use make with docker-compose** because you make sure to run it with the same version. Make raises the container with docker-compose, executes the task and removes the container, in this way the local machine is clean once you execute the commands, you can check the link:../Makefile[Makefile] file to see what commands you can run.
